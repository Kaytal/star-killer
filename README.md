# Star Killer

While it's potentially important to use the latest version of dependencies when you begin a project, it's possible that using the * version in your package.json file may create issues for developers working on your project a year from now if those dependencies introduce breaking changes. Star Killer is an easy and simple way to remove * from your package.json without needing to manually replace * with the correct version number.

# Install
Star Killer is a simple node package. Install globally:

`npm install -g star-killer`

# Usage

In any project where you want to kill stars, navigate in the command line to the directory that contains your package.json and run `star-killer`. That's it. You're done.
